## Dataset: FashionMNIST

The FashionMNIST dataset is a widely-used benchmark dataset in machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of fashion items in 10 different classes, with 7,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is 28x28 pixels in size and falls into one of the following categories:

- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

The FashionMNIST dataset is used for training machine learning and computer vision algorithms, providing a challenging task for image classification due to the variety of fashion items and their visual similarities.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib

### Plotting Loss

The training script will plot the training and validation losses over epochs.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of three convolutional layers, each followed by batch normalization and max-pooling, and three fully connected layers with dropout for regularization.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 92.42% on the test set. Individual class accuracies are also reported.
